# HPPTel-Characterisation-Speckle
Code of my semester project at the HPP telescope of ETH Zurich. Contains the characterisation of the new camera and the speckle imaging test.


## Description of the files:
```DevelopmentCamera.ipynb``` is the data processing of the camera characterisation.
```DevelopmentSpeckle.ipynb``` is the data analysis of the speckle imaging part.
```Plotting.ipynb``` was used to create the plot appearing in the report.

The data files are not here, as they are over 66 GB.
